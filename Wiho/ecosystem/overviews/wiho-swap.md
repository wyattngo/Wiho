# ðŸ“ˆ Wiho Swap

Wiho Swap functions as an exchange between two different tokens on the blockchain. These swap transactions are conducted through Wiho Swap using protocols or decentralized exchanges, allowing users to easily and quickly exchange Wiho and other tokens without the need for intermediaries such as banks or traditional exchanges.

For example, to perform a swap transaction between Bitcoin and Wiho, the user would exchange their Bitcoin and receive Wiho in return. The value of Wiho will be calculated based on the exchange rate between the two tokens in the current market, known as the swap rate. If the user accepts the transaction, it will be executed. The swap rate may vary over time depending on the supply and demand balance in the market.
