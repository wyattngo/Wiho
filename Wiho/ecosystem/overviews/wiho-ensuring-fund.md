1. **Determining Insurance Price:**

* The insurance price depends on the total value of assets you want to insure.

For example: If you want to insure 10 Bitcoins and the insurance rate is 2%, then the total insurance price you have to pay will be: 10 \* 10,000 \* 2% = 2,000 USD.
{% endhint %}

2. **Determining Compensation Percentage:**

* If the value of the assets decreases, you will be reimbursed a certain percentage as agreed upon in the insurance contract.

For example: If the compensation percentage is 80% and you sell 10 Bitcoins at a price of 5,000 USD each, then the amount of compensation you will receive will be: 10 \* (10,000 - 5,000) \* 80% = 40,000 USD.
{% endhint %}
