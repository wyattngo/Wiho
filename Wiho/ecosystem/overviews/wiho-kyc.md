### **KYC is only for Project Owners**

As you know, at Wiho we take the safety of our investors very seriously. We hate scams and rugpulls and, because of that, we have built many features and tools for you to be able to make informed decisions as to whether a presale is worth investing in or not.

Scrolling through the list of current and past presales, you might have noticed that several projects have a KYC badge next to their names. This brief article is designed to explain what that means and what it entails for all stakeholders.

### KYC Explained

At Wiho, Know Your Customer, or KYC is the process of identity verification to ascertain that the person speaking to us is really who she/he says they are. How does it work? The identities of the project owner is determined by submitting ID documentation (Passport, National ID) to an automated platform. This is similar to the KYC process needed when opening up a trading account on a major exchange like Binance, for example.

### What Does it Mean For You?

* We will reveal their identities.

**To investors:** If you have serious reservations about a project, and you have proofs that the project is a scam, please contact us ASAP, supplying as much evidence as possible. We will go through the claim and let you know the result of our investigation.
